*****  DRAFT IN PROCESS

In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Hawaiian International Conference on System Sciences I undertook an analysis of all the conference proceedings from 1968-2017. The focus was on tracking the changes in content from the early beginnings of IT to the present day.  In part, this turned out to be a massive project because of the substantial changes that occurred from 1968 to 2017 in the structure of the organization, conference and proceedings, as well as the changes in the media used to record the proceedings/abstracts/papers across the years -- from paper handouts, to bound paper volumes, to PDFs, to floppy disks, to CDs, to thumb drives and to online repositories.  The result is that much of the data collection for the years prior to 2000 had to be done manually (typing in various TOCs) or creating various programs to "scrape and clean" the myriad of data formats used from one year to the next. In the end, I decided to focus on analyzing the text from the titles found in the table of contents (TOCs) for each of the 50 track proceedings. In addition to the text, the TOCs also provided information about the changing structure of the conference as well as detailed information about the participants (and their affiliations).

The analysis was divided into two parts -- analysis of the changing structure and participation and text analysis of the changing content.

Changing structure and participation

While various formats were used 

<ul> 
<li> Data for the analysis of the general demographics of the conference - tracks, minitracks, authors and associated titles. These data are found in their original coded form in the zipfile <em>HICSS Conference Proceedings TOCs -1968-2017.zip</em> and in row format in the worksheet "Details-Trk-MT-PAP-Authors" in the Excel file <em>Trk-MiniT-Pap-Authors.xlsx</em>. For those who are interested in the demographics its probably best to use the worksheet rather than the original coded form.
<li> Data for the analysis of the textual analysis of the titles in the conference proceedings. Again, the underlying data for this analysis comes from the 
<li> Programs for setting up the data and for carrying out the demographic and the textual analysis
</ul>

A small number of potential visual analyses of the data can be found at:

<ul>
<li> The HICSS conference site --  http://hicss.hawaii.edu/ which covers 1977-2017 (selecting HICSS Evolution) -- which leads to Kaveh Abhari's tableau site:

This covers track and author information for the years 1977-2017</li>

<li> My public tableau site which provides all of the above, as well as the textual analysis for the years from 1968-2017:
