*****  DRAFT IN PROCESS

In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Hawaiian International Conference on System Sciences I undertook an analysis of all the conference proceedings from 1968-2017. The focus was on tracking the changes in content from the early beginnings of IT to the present day.  This turned out to be a massive project in large part because of the substantial changes that occurred in the structure of the organization, conference and proceedings, as well as the changes in the media used to record the proceedings/abstracts/papers across the years -- from paper, to bound paper volumes, to PDFs, to floppy disks, to CDs, to thumb drives and to online repositories.  The result is that much of the data collection for the years prior to 2000 had to be done manually (typing in various TOCs) or creating various programs designed to "scrape and clean" the myriad of data formats used from one year to the next In the end, I decided to focus on analyzing the titles from the table of contents the track proceedings for the 50 years.

A small number of visual analyses of the data can be found at:

<ul>
<li> The HICSS conference site --  http://hicss.hawaii.edu/ which covers 1977-2017 (selecting HICSS Evolution) -- which leads to Kaveh Abhari's tableau site:

This covers track and author information for the years 1977-2017</li>

<li> My public tableau site which provides all of the above, as well as the textual analysis for the years from 1968-2017:

The collection of files provided here includes:
<ul> 
<li> Data for the analysis of the general demographics of the conference - tracks, minitracks, authors and associated titles
<li> Data for the analysis of the textual analysis of the titles in the conference proceedings
<li> Programs for setting up the data and for carrying out the demographic and the textual analysis
